<h1>Video Game Recommendations </h1>
  <h3>by TheMoonlord</h3>
<p>Terraria is one of the best games ever (but that's just my opinion) which is why I made my name TheMoonlord! 
I recommend buying Terraria!</p>
  <p>Another game is <a href="https://fez.fandom.com/wiki/FEZ_Wiki">Fez</a>. 
    Fez is a puzzle game that changed my view on platformer-puzzles forever!</p>
<p>Also, Just Shapes and Beats is an awesome bullet-hell game where you dodge the pink things to the time of the music! 
  It sounds boring but it's not. Plus, it has
  the BEST soundtrack!</p>
<p>Some of the weapons from Terraria</p>

  <p>P.S. if u want to make a website like this go to <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">W3Schools.</a>
  it has lots of HTML and other languages(HTML is the language this page uses!)</p>
